# Almog Kurtser's Curriculum Vitae + build tools
My C.V, based on the modern-cv LaTeX template + build tools for easy compiling.

## Compile to PDF
  Simply run `make` to compile the C.V. or `make no_introduction` to remove the conditional rendered introduction (read!).


  A fair Warning: the docker image (`blang/latex`) is heavy (4.3 GB). It will only be used though if you don't have pdf build tools installed.
